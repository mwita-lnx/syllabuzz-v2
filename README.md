- **Sentence Transformers** for generating semantic embeddings

### üóÑÔ∏è **Data Layer**
- **MongoDB**: Primary database for structured data
- **Qdrant**: Vector database for semantic search
- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **File Storage**: Secure file upload and management

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```

## Workflow Examples

### Instructor Workflow

1. Register/login as an instructor
2. Create a new course
3. Add units to the course
4. Upload past papers for each unit (system extracts questions)
5. Upload lecture notes for each unit (system extracts sections)
6. Review automatically linked questions and notes

### Student Workflow

1. Register/login as a student
2. Browse available courses and units
3. View questions from past papers
4. Search for specific topics or questions
5. View frequently asked questions
6. For any question, view related notes sections

## Using Embeddings for Semantic Search

The application uses sentence-transformers to create vector embeddings for questions and note sections. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, enabling similarity comparisons that go beyond simple keyword matching.

Key benefits:
- Find similar questions even when wording is different
- Connect questions to relevant notes based on meaning
- Group related questions to identify frequently tested concepts

## Future Enhancements

1. **React Frontend**: Implement a user-friendly frontend interface
2. **Advanced NLP Features**: Incorporate more advanced NLP techniques for better extraction
3. **AI-Generated Practice Questions**: Generate new practice questions based on patterns
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide insights into frequently tested topics
5. **Mobile App**: Develop a companion mobile application

## Technical Implementation Notes

- The system uses cosine similarity for comparing embeddings
- Questions are grouped when similarity exceeds a threshold (default 0.85)
- PDF extraction uses a combination of regex patterns and NLP techniques
- MongoDB is used for its flexibility with embedding vectors and nested data
